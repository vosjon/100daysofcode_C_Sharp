# 100daysofcode_C_Sharp
I want to stay up on C# while learning Python. I will create the same projects in C# as long as it is possible to do so.

Completed Projects:

[Day One - Band Name Generator](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayOne/BandNameGenerator.cs)

[Day Two - Tip Calculator](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayTwo/TipCalculator.cs)

[Day Three - Treasure Island](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayThree/TreasureIsland.cs)

[Day Four - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayFour/RockPaperScissors.cs)
