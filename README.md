# 100daysofcode_C_Sharp
I want to stay up on C# while learning Python. I will create the same projects in C# as long as it is possible to do so.

Completed Projects:

[Day One - Band Name Generator](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayOne/BandNameGenerator.cs)

[Day Two - Tip Calculator](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayTwo/TipCalculator.cs)

[Day Three - Treasure Island](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayThree/TreasureIsland.cs)

[Day Four - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayFour/RockPaperScissors.cs)

[Day Five - Password Generator](https://github.com/vosjon/100daysofcode_C_Sharp/blob/main/DayFive/PasswordGenerator.cs)

[Day Six - Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html) Day six involved playing various Reeborg's world game and using while loops to solve the hurdles games along with the maze. Reeborg's World does not use C#, so I don't have anything today. The link will take you to the site if you want to try it for yourself.
